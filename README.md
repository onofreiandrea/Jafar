# Jafar

## The programming language Jafar was created during the module Programming Paradigms, by team 8 : Vo Nhat Minh, Tran Duc Duc and Andrea Onofrei. 
  The syntax of our programming language - Jafar is reminiscent of languages Java, Pascal and Python. As the language from which it was inspired, it is a   strongly typed language â€“ we enforce firm restrictions on mixing different data types and values.
